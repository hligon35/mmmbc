<p>Mt. Moriah Missionary Baptist Church, our past has been rewarding because God has been merciful to us for 74 years. He chided us when we strayed, but He allowed us to prosper when we obeyed. He only asked that we “do justly, and love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.” Micah 6:8.</p>
<p>To recapture some of the facts that have shaped our spiritual heritage, we note that the Congregation of this church was formed out of the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church. The church was originally named Husband Street. Looking back, it was an old store front church in a very dilapidated condition with a flat top roof, concrete floors, two doors facing north and a side door facing west.</p>
<p>At this place on the corner of Tenth and Husband Streets, we worshipped for 45 years. Reverend D.W. Crenshaw was the founder of the church. There was very little improvement to the physical structure of the building during his pastorate. However, members recall that he was a powerful speaker who inspired many people. The church building in which we worshipped, though ragged, was known throughout the community for its spiritual vitality and dedicated laborers who were determined to walk with Jesus. Three of the first deacons were Deacon Adams, Deacon Shelton and Deacon Lawrence. Reverend Crenshaw remained until poor health forced him to resign.</p>
<p>Reverend R.L. Carter was called as our second pastor and served for a very short period of time, and again we were without a leader.</p>
<p>Reverend J. Young, a faithful member of the church, accepted the pastorate for a brief period and then offered his resignation. He continued to work in the church until he suffered a stroke while reviewing the Sunday School lesson. He died that same day.</p>
<p>Our next pastor was Reverend L.S. Biles, who came here first in 1939 and 1940 and conducted inspirational services and a state rally. It wasn’t until August 1941 that he was called to the pastorate of the church. He accepted this call in November 1941, filling the pulpit two Sundays each month. He immediately began plans for remodeling the building and a financial drive ended on Christmas morning. Two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225) was raised by the faithful members and friends. After the money for the drive was reported, a silver offering of eighteen dollars ($18) was presented to the newly elected pastor.</p>
<p>At the first business meeting in January 1941, another financial drive was set, and six hundred eighty dollars ($680) was raised to begin paying for remodeling materials so that the building could be torn down and walls rebuilt along with new windows, wood floors and the choir stand enlarged. Mr. Will Kird did the carpentry work, and the brick masonry was done by Lemuel VanDyke. Each member also agreed to work. During the remodeling, the church worshipped at the Recreation Center at Tenth and Jones for sixty (60) days and then returned in July to worship in the new church. The remodeling totaled approximately three thousand dollars ($3000), and the monies were raised by pledges, offerings, and donations.</p>
<p>We served in that building until the membership and regular attendance outgrew the church and it became necessary to expand. A 16 foot addition was made and a modern baptistery was installed along with a choir room, deacon’s room, a very modern pastor’s study, electric organ, and new chairs for the choir stand.</p>
<p>Later a 28×38 foot recreation building was built in the back of the church. It was used to prepare and serve meals and to provide a place for church members to fellowship. In 1948, at the close of Reverend Biles’ anniversary, he presented deeds for five houses and lots to the trustee board.</p>
<p>In July 1942 the Ever-Ready Chorus, consisting of the youth of the church, was organized by the pastor’s wife, Mrs. Ruby Biles. She served as instructor and pianist. Mrs. Effie Watkins also served as director of the chorus. The first president was Dorothy Faye Suggs. Valerie Newsome became the third president. This was a working and singing group of dedicated young people. We had two other singing groups-the Senior or Number One Choir and the Gospel Chorus. During this period there was not a lot of money earned by the members, but they gave willingly to the support of the church. We took busloads to Sunday School, to church conventions and to worship in other cities throughout the state.</p>
<p>Brother Will Suggs was one of our faithful deacons who also served as church clerk and treasurer for many years. Other deacons were Brother Tom Titsworth, who also served many years as superintendent of the Sunday School and church custodian. Brothers Will Hall, Floyd Matthews, Hawley Flye, McKinley Doyle, Thomas Gaines, Eugene Marthell, Galvester Stevens, Frank Frazier, Henry Brown, Willie Carroll, Dave Vinegar, Curlee Brown, Clayborn Biles, John Henry Johnson, Archie Wilson, Harry Jones, Everett Biles, Jewell Perry, Ira Newsome, Robert Shumpert, and Robert Anderson.</p>
<p>Mothers of the church were Sallie Catlett, Sina Adams, Stella Bennett, Annie Rigsby, Ethel White, Isabelle Mack, Kitty Ridley, Mary Pittman, Estella Hall, Ruby Marthell, Annie Baines, Eliza Morris, Amanda Brownlee, Clara Hogans, Fannie Biles, Georgeann Lawrence, Ella Johnson, and Mary Shaw.</p>
<p>Reverends V.J. Smith, John Suggs, and Louis Brown were called to the ministry under Reverend Biles’ pastorate.</p>
<p>In 1951 Reverend Biles resigned, and we were left without a shepherd. He can be remembered as a truly great leader. Under his leadership we became aware that “The Lord Hath Done Great Things For Us, Whereof We Are Glad.”</p>
<p>Reverend J.W. Haley was called in 1952 but became ill shortly thereafter. Even though he was ill during most of his tenure, the church continued to support and help him until he decided to resign due to his continued illness. He stepped down in 1954.</p>
<p>Our next pastor was Reverend W.L. Lindsey who came to us in 1955 from Memphis, Tennessee. He was a dynamic speaker, and his wife was a great pianist. She played for the Golden Tone Spiritual Singers, which was organized in February 1955. The last meeting of the Golden Tone Spiritual Singers was held at the home of Brother Curlee Brown. Reverend Anderson was the business manager, and Reverend Lindsey was the narrator. Members were Alberta Brown, Gloria Moore, Irma Flye, Willie Mayes, Etta Leonard, Archie Wilson, John H. Johnson, Harry Jones, Curlee Brown and Ira Newsome.</p>
<p>Following Reverend Lindsey, Reverend W.K. Seals became our fifth pastor in 1957. He can be most remembered for his scholastic abilities for, truly, he was a great teacher and preacher who taught us the Bible and about tithing. Under his leadership we became more involved in missionary work, including foreign missions.</p>
<p>Some of the deacons during Reverend Seals’ pastorate were Archie Wilson, Harry Jones, Curlee Brown, Clayborne Biles, Everett Biles, Robert Anderson, Will Hall, Ira Newsome, Robert Shumpert, Jewell Perry, G.W. Williams, Dave Vinegar, Jimmy Harber, James Parker, and Lawrence Milliken. All these were taught and ordained by Reverend Seals.</p>
<p>After Reverend Seals was here approximately four years, we found ourselves located in the area where the present Blackburn Courts was to be built. When we were informed that we were going to have to move from the location where we had served for 45 blessed years, there were many mixed feelings. Yet, this was a blessing from God since our church was in need of so many repairs and we had outgrown the structure. We, being a church willing to accept leadership, all prayed. With Reverend Seals working with the official board and the church, we were able to purchase the church at Sixth and Ohio Streets. The cornerstone contained the following information:</p>
<p>Sixth Street Missionary Baptist Church purchased October 15, 1961. Brother Ira Newsome (Chairman of Deacons), Clayborne Biles (Chairman of Trustees), Robert Anderson (Clerk), and Reverend W K. Seals, (Pastor).</p>
<p>On a bright and glorious Sunday morning in May 1962, Pastor Seals led the congregation down the streets of Paducah to the location which was completely paid for. This church, though not new, was as beautiful to us as the present sanctuary is now.</p>
<p>We soon renamed the church “Sixth Street”. We were doing great things! We purchased a new piano and organ, a church bus, and a parsonage on Tennessee Street. Reverend J.H. Perry, our associate minister, Robert Anderson, Carl Alexander and Robert Ross accepted the call of ministry under Reverend Seals and were ordained. Reverend Seals encouraged these ministers and wanted to teach them. It was during his pastorate that we became aware of the Hopkinsville College of the Bible. Reverend Seals was instrumental in setting up the extension of that school in Paducah. It started in the basement of Sixth Street Church.</p>
<p>Reverend Seals resigned after ten (10) years of service in 1967. After his departure, the Reverend Rayfield Sanford acted as pastor for one year. Brothers Ira Newsome, Robert Shumpert, James Parker, and Galvester Stevens were often the only deacons present to serve and conduct the official business of the church. The membership dwindled over the years, but the prayers, sweat, tears and spiritual influence of these saintly servants of Christ, weathered the storm of adversity.</p>
<p>The late Reverend C.A. Dawson came to us in April 1968 and remained for eight (8) faithful years. He was a kind person and loved by everyone. The church began to move forward under his leadership. Central heating and air conditioning, a water fountain and public address system were installed, the dining area and both restrooms were remodeled, the auditorium was carpeted and choir robes for the Senior Choir and Ever Ready Chorus were obtained. He is most remembered for his ability to recognize a cooperative spirit in the church-that’s of the links that pulled us together-and he encouraged this. Surely the Lord was in the plan when he sent Reverend Dawson to us during this period. He was able to pull this congregation together, and it began to grow. The church accomplished many great things under his leadership, but the most significant factor in our small congregation was the love that existed.</p>
<p>After Reverend Dawson left, Reverend Jewell Perry and Sam Jones acted as pastors until Reverend West accepted the call in October 1976. He found a small congregation with the loving spirit of a Christian family, faith, ideas and dreams. As a congregation who supported Reverend West’s ideas, we were able to accomplish many great things. Our membership increased tremendously. With encouragement and Biblical teaching from him, the church accepted his and God’s plan to finance the church through tithes and offerings only. We decided to cease using man’s way to finance our plans for the future. Reverend West’s motto was: “You cannot improve on God’s plan.” A new parsonage was purchased on Harrison Street, as well as a new baptistery was installed, new offering tables, collection trays and tithe boxes. The church membership continued to grow spiritually and financially. Pastor West presented his future plans to build a church. We worked for a year to prepare ourselves financially before we began that task.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1977 the roof of the church was severely damaged and began to show signs of deterioration. The walls began to bulge outward, and the city advised us that the building was no longer safe for occupancy. Our hearts were saddened, because we felt we were not yet ready to make the move to build. However, we became more increasingly aware that out of everything bad, something good does happen; God sends rain to make us appreciate the sunshine. If we had sunshine all the time, we would tend to forget to pray and to remain humble and grateful.</p>
<p>Pastor West was a courageous young minister who, we believed, had undying faith. It took courage to keep the congregation together while we were without a place to worship and without a clue as to where we would worship in the future.</p>
<p>We began to search for a new place. We were worshipping at the Paducah Community Center on South Eighth Street when the officials at the center graciously opened its doors to us. We remained humbly grateful because it seemed as though history was repeating itself (Under Reverend Biles’ pastorate we worshipped at a recreational center, and the pews were brought over from the old church to the Center).</p>
<p>Our first service at the Center was on February 12, 1978. Worshipping at the Center was not an easy task since it had to be set up prior to every service either on Saturday night or early Sunday morning. We had to borrow chairs from Macedonia Baptist Church. There was also the task of dismantling the chairs after each service. Many of the young men of the church such as Redell Benton, Henderson Hawkins, William T. Jones, William Stanley Jones, Richard Washington, Jeffrey Allen, Leon Biles, Masters David Jones and Tony Benton, Deacons Ira Newsome and Curtis Newbern, as well as Pastor West and several faithful members always assisted in this duty. Mr. Harlan Brazier, a carpentry instructor at West Kentucky State Vocational School, saw that we were in need of a podium, and he built one for us. Brother Stan Jones set up the public address system each week, and we had some glorious services at the center. Macedonia Baptist Church graciously opened its doors for our weekly and Sunday afternoon programs. The Lord continued to send laborers into the fields. It was while worshipping at the Center that many became ever mindful that the church is not a building, but it is in the hearts of men.</p>
<p>The desire was still to have a church building of our own, if possible. Plans were implemented to build a church around the beginning of 1978. We began to meet with bankers, contractors, and our official board to determine what we had and where we were going. In 1978 we received approval from Citizens Bank to finance the building of a new church, and the name was changed to Mount Moriah in July. Again, it seemed as if history was repeating itself when we purchased the land on the corner of Eighth and Husband Streets, two blocks from where we had begun. This property was discovered through the efforts of Brother Leon Biles. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held at the new church site in October 1978.</p>
<p>We soon learned that New Ebenezer Church was without a pastor. Viewing a possible blessing before us, Pastor West met with the members of New Ebenezer Baptist Church. They were without a leader, and we were without a church building in which to worship. After a few weeks, the two families joined officially as one family in Christ on the first Sunday in March 1978.</p>
<p>God really smiled on all during those wonderful days together. Still, a church needs to have its own pastor and in January 1979, New Ebenezer extended the call to Reverend Charles Edmonds. Upon his accepting the call, our church moved back to the Community Center. Although Pastor Edmonds, on his first Sunday as pastor, invited us to continue to worship there, Pastor West recognized that Reverend Edmonds needed to lead his flock without us. Our love and gratitude for these beautiful Christian people cannot be expressed in words; however, they shall remain in our hearts forever because of their generosity and kindness during our time of need.</p>
<p>On January 14, 1979, we moved back to the Community Center and remained there until we were able to move into our present sanctuary. Again, we had to set up and dismantle prior to and after each service and continue to borrow chairs from ever loyal Macedonia Baptist. They and their gracious pastor, Reverend Alfred Anderson, opened their doors for our weekly meetings, Sunday afternoon programs, and whatever our needs were. We continued to have a wonderful time in the name of the Lord while worshipping at the Community Center and are forever indebted to the congregation at Macedonia. While at the Community Center, many people continued to join our church family, and Brother Hulon Warren announced his call to the ministry. He became Pastor West’s first son in the ministry and preached his first sermon at Macedonia Baptist in May 1979. Also, out of a need to maintain fellowship, the girls’ softball team was organized in 1979 with Homer Chandler as their coach. The first year, a third-place trophy was won and in 1989 two second place trophies were won. The 1980 coaches were Tony Thurman and Homer Chandler.</p>
<p>Although we are strong in faith, the support and encouragement received from our Christian brothers and sisters throughout this community helped us to be where we are today. Many churches throughout Paducah offered us a meeting place at any time. The Union Choir, always exemplifying the spirit of Christianity and under the leadership of Brother Willard Staples, made contributions. We had pledges for our members to give one hundred dollars ($100) toward the building fund, and many people in the community contributed; some gave one hundred dollars ($100) and more.</p>
<p>The Inspirational Voices, a mass choir under the direction of Keith Walters and Corine Harber, gave a concert at Washington Street Baptist Church and donated the money to our church. There were times when we became somewhat discouraged, but due to the support of the majority of the community, our courage was strengthened, and we continued to press on. We remained humble and grateful for all the help received and, especially, the unceasing prayers.</p>
<p>My Lord, What a Morning when we were able to march to the new church! We, truly, had come this far by faith. A most beautiful dedication service was held October 28, 1979, and our guests from South Bend, Indiana, were Reverend F.D. Johnson and his congregation of Macedonia Baptist Church and the Reverend Samuel Chase, Jr. and his congregation of Second Baptist Church.</p>
<p>After worshipping in this particular sanctuary all these years, we recognize the important accomplishment is not the building, even though we realize its beauty and that it is truly a blessing from God, but rather that there are still souls coming to join God’s army. We feel the exact number is irrelevant since God is keeping a record. Some of the most joyful events have occurred here, yet we have had sad occasions, too.</p>
<p>During our last Sunday service at the W.C.Young Community Center, Aline Griffin was the first person to unite with us and became the first new member of Mt. Moriah. The first baptismal service was held November 4, 1979, and the candidates were: Felicia Tyler, Tammie Griffin, Eushleka Payne, Ocie Brown, Dean Tyler, Coticia Blue and three brothers-Kurt, Percy and Charles Farris. Four new deacons were ordained on December 9, 1979, and they were: Henderson Hawkins, Redell Benton, William Stanley Jones, and William T. Jones. Edward Henry and Vivian Crockett were the first people to be married in the church. Nicole Jones, daughter of Reverend &amp; Mrs. William T. Jones, was the first child to be dedicated in the church with Pastor and Mrs. West as the godparents. Christie Harber was the youngest child to ever accept Christ and to be baptized during Reverend West’s pastorate. William T. Jones, the first son to preach his sermon in this church, preached that sermon on August 23, 1989. Our hearts were saddened when we lost Deacon Henry Brown, but we realized God loved him best. The Reverend Samuel Chase conducted our first revival services on October 6-10, 1980, and he delivered some powerful sermons.</p>
<p>Other accomplishments during Reverend West’s leadership included: the ordination of Brothers Curtis Newbern, Kenneth Boyd, Leonard Shaw, Cleophus Shumpert, and Jeffrey Allen as deacons on December 4, 1977. Weldon Stokes, Lamar Keys, and Calvin Cole, Sr. were also ordained as deacons in the 80s.</p>
<p>The Nurses Unit was organized with Shirley Conner as the first president. Curtis Newbern became the first president of the pastor’s aid committee. He also organized the Male Chorus and William Pruitt was the first president. Donna Hawkins and Donna Menefee were the musicians for the Male Chorus. The Senior Choir and the Ever-Ready Chorus were combined into the Mass Choir, and Pastor West gave instructions to the ushers. They were known throughout the community and respected in the church for their excellent abilities to serve and be door keepers in the house of the Lord.</p>
<p>The 80s proved to be a productive decade for Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church. A “New Member Orientation” class was started October 12, 1980. The youth of the church were given the responsibility of leadership of a church service on October 26, and they continue that responsibility every fourth Sunday. The men’s basketball team was coached by Pastor West. Also, in 1980 our church van was paid for in full, and in 1982 the pews were paid. In 1984 the ushers purchased new uniforms with maroon as their color choice.</p>
<p>In 1985 the Mass Choir presented Black Legacy under the direction of Lydia Williams. Choir members dressed in slave attire and sang old Negro Spirituals. This was also performed at the Oscar Cross Boy’s Club fundraiser. In June of 1986, Mount Moriah had its first Vacation Bible School directed by Lydia and Darrell Williams.</p>
<p>The choir, in need of robes for several years, undertook the project of purchasing new robes. With the Lord’s help, donations from church members, and spending their own money, the robes were dedicated July 12, 1987.</p>
<p>On August 2, 1987, after eleven years of service, Reverend Terry West resigned. We were not, however, without a spiritual leader. Reverend Lawrence Milliken, associate minister, carried on our church services. Then, on September 27, 1987, the Lord blessed us with our new pastor, Reverend Lawrence Brown Milliken. Sister Carrie Johnson suggested we set aside an entire month for a love offering for our church. The month designated was September. Pastor Milliken named September the “Carrie Johnson Love Month”. The fourth Saturday was designated for the Annual Church Picnic.</p>
<p>Under Reverend Milliken’s leadership we have been blessed with an increasing number of new members. In August 1988, a new organ was purchased. In September 1988, a baby grand piano was purchased, and Brothers Gene Bryant and Jimmy Harber installed the church marquee. Reverend Laird Jones was called to the ministry on January 5, 1989.</p>
<p>God has blessed us richly with additions to our church and we are thankful for that. In 1990 God sent 31 new members into the church family. In 1991, 31 more were added and 35 by Watch Care from Golconda Job Corps Center. In 1992 the church purchased a new keyboard to enhance our music ministry. We know that all things work together for good to them that love God. To them who are called according to his purpose.</p>
<p>Due to health reasons, Rev. Milliken resigned in 2000 and Rev. Louis Moore became our interim pastor. Under his leadership, we were able to keep the church family together.</p>
<p>In the late 1970’s Pastor Cole joined the Mt. Moriah Church Family under Christian experience. He served as the finance chief and sang with the male chorus. He was ordained as a deacon in 1979. The Lord called him into the ministry, and he was ordained and received his license on November 14, 1983. Under the leadership of Rev. Terry J. West, Sr., he became one of Mt. Moriah’s proudest Sons.</p>
<p>The White Oak Baptist Church called him as their pastor in 1984. He served there until February 8, 2001.</p>
<p>After many prayers, the church called Rev. Calvin R. Cole, Sr., telling him he was needed at home, Mt. Moriah. Pastor Cole is OBEDIENT. Before returning to Mt. Moriah, we are sure that he considered how he was going to tackle challenges and reach goals. He wanted to be in the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing.</p>
<p>He came to Mt. Moriah standing firm on God’s Word and walking according to His instructions. That requires phenomenal courage and faith like Abraham. “As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: do it.”</p>
<p>Under his leadership, Mt. Moriah has been blessed with several accomplishments. A few are listed below:</p>
